# 42 Libft

Welcome to the 42 Libft project repository! This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and focuses on creating your own C library containing useful standard functions.

## Introduction

The 42 Libft project involves creating a library of standard C functions that you will use frequently throughout your time at 42. The goal is to implement your own versions of standard functions from the C standard library, such as string manipulation functions, memory allocation functions, and more.

## Features

- Implementation of standard C library functions
- String manipulation functions (e.g., `strlen`, `strcpy`, `strcat`)
- Memory allocation functions (e.g., `malloc`, `free`, `realloc`)
- Linked list manipulation functions (e.g., `lstnew`, `lstadd_front`, `lstsize`)
- Additional utility functions (e.g., `atoi`, `itoa`, `isdigit`, `isalpha`)
